    {"title": "Ongoing Support", "text": "Good onboarding is helpful, but ongoing support matters just as much. Check response times, what support covers, and whether you’ll need to pay more for continued help."},
    {"title": "CRM Integration", "text": "Look for two-way syncing. Your partner activity, pipeline, and CRM data should stay in step without creating extra work for your team."},
    {"title": "Channel Marketing and Multi-Tier Support", "text": "If you’re planning co-branded marketing, MDF, incentives, multi-tier partners, or deeper enablement, you must check whether the platform can handle those needs."},
    {"title": "Implementation Requirements", "text": "Some platforms can be up and running in days, while others need a much bigger implementation. Introw and Kiflo are lighter options, while ZINFI, Mindmatrix, Channelscaler, and Impartner take more work to roll out. Pick based on the team and time you actually have."},
    {"title": "Program Strategy and Support", "text": "Usually we see platforms giving you the software and leave the program design to your team. JazzHQ is different here, with support for program design, partner recruitment, activation, and execution. If you’re still building the partner motion itself, that can be a much bigger advantage than another feature."},

  intro: "Euler is hard to beat when it comes to quick implementation and hands-on support, especially for lean teams. But it may not check every box for your partner program.",
  choices: [
    "Pick JazzHQ when you want program strategy and software support under the same roof.",
    "If you need a lightweight tool you might want to choose Introw or Kiflo.",
    "Impartner or ZINFI if you need deeper feature sets.",
    "Mindmatrix is the option for you if you want AI to stay on top of your partner motion and a done-for-you set up.",
    "And, when your focus is more on having an intuitive interface with deep incentives Channeltivity, Channelscaler, partnerstack might be worth the try,",
    "And if you're looking for an affordable option with a portal-free model, Kiflo might be the one for you.",
    "Salesforce Partner Cloud fits naturally when your partner operations already run on Salesforce and you want to keep everything in the same ecosystem.",

  items: [
    {"question": "1. Which is the best alternative that combines both a PRM software and a strategy?", "answer": "JazzHQ is the strongest choice if you want both the PRM platform and help building your partner strategy. It has worked with SaaS and AI companies on partner-program design, recruitment, onboarding, and go-to-market playbooks, while its platform now brings partner management, enablement, and operations into one place."},
    {"question": "2. What should partnership leaders look for in an Euler alternative?", "answer": "Look beyond the feature list. The right Euler alternative should fit how your partner program actually runs, including CRM integration, deal and lead management, partner onboarding, incentives, reporting, ease of implementation, and the level of strategy or support available. If your team is lean, prioritize a platform that is easy to launch and manage without adding unnecessary complexity."},
    {"question": "3. Do you really need a PRM to help manage partner operations?", "answer": "While it is possible to manage partner operations without a PRM, it becomes harder to keep track of partner data, deals, onboarding, incentives, and performance as the program grows. A PRM brings these workflows into one place, reducing manual work and giving partnership teams a clearer view of what’s happening across their partner ecosystem."},
